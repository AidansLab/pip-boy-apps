### Description

PipTube lets Vault residents browse holotapes and loop training films directly
in the Pip-Boy's DATA interface, calibrated for the approved 340x210 viewport.

### Controls

- Use the top-left knob to scroll the file list, press to open folders or play a
  video file. Press during playback to stop.
- Use the top-right knob to scroll the file list.
- Use the top-right torch button to toggle the screen brightness.
- Use the bottom-right power button to exit the game.

### Instructions

1. Copy your `.avi` videos to the device (e.g., `/VIDEOS`). You can use the
   [Media Converter Tool](https://github.com/CodyTolene/pip-boy-3000-mk-v-media-converter/releases)
   to convert videos to the correct format.
2. Keep file paths short (≤ 56 chars total) and videos sized correctly for the
   player window, ≤ 340 px wide x ≤ 210 px high.
3. Open PIPTUBE, select a video, then press the left knob to play. Playback
   loops until stopped.

### Notes

- Only folders containing at least one `.avi` are listed.
- Videos exceeding the player window size are playable, but will overlay the UI.
