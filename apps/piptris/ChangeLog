- Add a few optimizations for block rendering:
  - Add new block sprite to replace the more complex manually drawn 3D blocks.

  - Using the block sprite also fixes the music skipping when blocks were first drawn previously.
  - Load nuke & block images into memory for resuse on app initialization.
- Fix recursion issue in music playback. Thanks [Theeohn](https://github.com/Theeohn) for the report!
