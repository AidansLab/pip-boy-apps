### Description

Pip UI+ aims to add some of the missing in-game tabs (such as special, perks,
and so on) to the Pip-Boy 3000 Mk V. Inspired by gnargle's Stats Display.

### Instructions

The 'STAT' page will now have the 'SPECIAL' and 'PERKS' tabs which you can mess
around with.

### Tips

Click the torch button while on the 'PERKS' page to edit your perks.

### Warning

Bootloader apps can cause general slowness and instability as they run with the
main firmware, so use them with caution. If you experience issues, especially
with apps that run by themselves, try disabling bootloader apps.
