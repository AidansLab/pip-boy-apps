### Description

Pip UI+ expands the capabilities of the Pip‑Boy 3000 Mk V by adding familiar
in‑game elements like the SPECIAL and PERKS tabs, making your stats screen feel
complete. It also introduces new interface features such as a RAM usage monitor
for real‑time performance insight, as well as hiding certain elements to reduce
clutter.

### Instructions

After installing, you can modify your UI by navigating to the Pip UI+ options
app under INV > APPS. Here, you can toggle various UI features on and off.

### Tips

Click the torch button while on the 'PERKS' tab to modify your perks.

### Warning

Bootloader apps can cause general slowness and instability as they run with the
main firmware, so use them with caution. If you experience issues, especially
with apps that run by themselves, try disabling bootloader apps.
