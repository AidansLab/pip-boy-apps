has some basic info on developing Pip-Boy apps.

+ All apps should be created under the `apps/` directory with a unique name.
+ Each app should have a `metadata.json` file that contains the basic information about your app, the `id` in this file should match the directory name it is contained within.
+ Each app should also contain a `Changelog` file that outlines basic changes made to each version of your app.
